# Statement of Interest

I am an undergraduate student in computer science at the Technical University of
Munich. My interests are formal verification, the design and analysis of
algorithms, and the semantics of programming languages.
Additionally, I am particularly interested in the spreading of core open-source
concepts to more areas.

## Research interests

When we built a website in my first computer science lesson in high school I
immediately knew I was deeply fascinated by computers. The possibilities seemed
endless. Now, doing my undergraduate degree in computer science, my fascination
is bigger than ever before but my perspective has changed significantly.
There are still so many problems that computers cannot easily solve - or solve
at all. The formal verification of systems is one of the culprits. To that end,
I'm interested in the formalization of algorithms to prove their correctness as
well as the verification of certain properties of programs using extended type
systems. Furthermore, my interests include designing algorithms (precise and
approximative) for challenging problems and analyzing their propoerties.

## Other interests

Since many years I've been working in the open-source community.
Therefore one of my main concerns is the spreading of the open-source philosophy
and its fundamental concepts like transparency, inclusiveness, and open
collaboration into other areas.

I greatly enjoy teaching and collective discovery with students. During my
undergraduate degree I held a revision course on Functional Programming and
Verification as well as Discrete Probability Theory. Additionally, I tutored in
Functional Programming and Verification. Thinking about hard problems together
and collectively coming up with a solution is incredibly rewarding to me. On top
of that, designing a course structure and exercises led me to see these topics
from entirely different angles.
