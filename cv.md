# Jonas Hübotter

[jonas.huebotter@gmail.com](mailto:jonas.huebotter@gmail.com) | [https://jonhue.github.io](https://jonhue.github.io)

I am an undergraduate student in computer science at the Technical University of
Munich. My interests are the formal verification, the design and analysis of
algorithm, and the semantics of programming languages.
Additionally, I am particularly interested in the spreading of open-source to
more areas of application.
