# Jonas Hübotter

[jonas.huebotter@gmail.com](mailto:jonas.huebotter@gmail.com) | [https://jonhue.github.io](https://jonhue.github.io)

I am an undergraduate student in computer science at the Technical University of
Munich. My main research interests are the design and analysis of algorithms,
the semantics of programming languages, type systems and formal verification.

I am also interested in free and open-source software, information theory, and 
branches of philosophy and psychology like cognitive science.
