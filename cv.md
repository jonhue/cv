# Jonas Hübotter

[jonas.huebotter@gmail.com](mailto:jonas.huebotter@gmail.com) | [https://jonhue.github.io](https://jonhue.github.io)

I am an undergraduate student in computer science at the Technical University of
Munich. My main research interests are the design and analysis of algorithms,
the semantics of programming languages, type systems and formal verification.
I am also particularly interested in the spreading of core open-source
concepts to more areas.
